## 1.0	Requirements Specification

## 1.1	Introduction
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents the requirements for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Database Web Application called
CrookBook. The CrookBook Database is a relational database that will allow LAPD
to enter in and find police case data with ease. The procedure will be done across the Internet from a desktop computer or laptop and the application is built and tailored for the needs of LAPD. The application is meant to provide authorized LAPD personnel data reports that indicate cases that are worthwhile investigating. The Web Application will be built with a three-tier client/server architecture. So at a high level, the user will be interacting with a Graphical User Interface completed by a frontend framework. 

The following table defines the language used in specifying requirements in this document. Only 'shall' statements are explicit requirements for this project.

| Type   | Definition                                    |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Shall  | Expresses mandatory provision.                |
| Should | Expresses non-mandatory provision.            |
| Will   | Declaration of purpose such as a design goal. |
