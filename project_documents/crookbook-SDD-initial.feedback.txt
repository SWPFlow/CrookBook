
Hi, CrookBook team ----

Good job on the Preliminary SDD!  The ERD is effin' AWESOME!  Your
CSCI descriptions and data descriptions are great -- way past the
required level for a preliminary design.  You won't have much work to
do for the detailed design.....

Just a couple of things:
1) the "class" diagram isn't a class diagram.  Rather than change it,
   just rename it to be "Top-level Diagram"
2) likewise, the "UML Use Case Diagram" isn't one of those, either.
   Rename it to "CrookBook Activity Flow" or some such
3) the state diagram just needs a couple of boxes renamed, like the
   "Advanced Search Page" should be "On Advanced Search Page" and so on
4) same for the diagram below that; "Displaying Cases" not just "Cases"
5) note that UML state diagrams are supposed to use boxes with rounded
   corners.  But I don't care for this effort.

Very nice work.

Fix these items in the next release for full credit on the document.

You have 10% out of 10% which is an A-plus.

Regards,
Prof. Johnson
